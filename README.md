Assembly Snake for MASM v5 and DOSBox

Wanted to try some assembly, so this is my first try at it. 
I can recommend this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvpbDCl_H7mfgmEJPl1bTHlH5g-f0kWDM). Really good.

Compiles with MASM v5 and runs in DosBOX. Screen seems to flicker, but I don't know why.
